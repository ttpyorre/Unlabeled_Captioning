The project makes available a standard corpus of reasonable size (0.8 billion words) 
to train and evaluate language models.

A few sample results we obtained at Google on this data are detailed at:
papers/naaclhlt2013.pdf

Besides the scripts needed to rebuild the training/held-out data, it also makes 
available log-probability values for each word in each of ten feld-out data sets, 
for each of the following baseline models:
. unpruned Katz (1.1B n-grams),
. pruned Katz (~15M n-grams), 
. unpruned Interpolated Kneser-Ney (1.1B n-grams), 
. pruned Interpolated Kneser-Ney (~15M n-grams)

The corpus is derived from the training-monolingual.tokenized/news.20??.en.shuffled.tokenized data distributed at http://statmt.org/wmt11/translation-task.html, Monolingual language model training data (Download it all in one file, 11 GB, at http://statmt.org/wmt11/training-monolingual.tgz). 

Corpus preparation:
====================
. download the "Monolingual language model training data" (http://statmt.org/wmt11/training-monolingual.tgz, 11 GB). 
$ tar --extract -v --file ../statmt.org/tar_archives/training-monolingual.tgz --wildcards training-monolingual/news.20??.en.shuffled
followed by:
$ ./scripts/get-data.sh

For a more detailed description see README.corpus_generation.

Baseline Language Models:
==========================
. trained and evaluated Katz and Interpolated Kneser-Ney language models.

. the word-level probability assignment for each word in the first 10 shards of the test data
(including the 00000 shard above for which we report LM performance) is available at:
baseline-lms/log/output.tar (tar-ed gzip files; due to their relatively large size they
are hosted on gDrive at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3u4EqGe3BUeMWhPS1hkdDZvTjA/edit?usp=sharing).

The output is in the following format:
...
WORDS: <S> Hello , world ! </S>
WORD IDS: 0 1044976486 1699010037 1539844246 217790329 1

The output first repeats the input sentence (with <S> and </S> added). Then it shows the corresponding integer word ids. Subsequent lines list ProdLM entries obtained with ProdLMClient and the resulting smoothed cost calculated by ProdLMWrapper. For each word, it shows the entries for the unigram, bigram, trigram etc. ending in the word shown at the beginning of the line. The example above shows a fourgram model. Thus, the first column after the hyphen shows the fourgram entry, followed by the trigram, bigram and unigram entries 1.234405e+01.

The first word of the sentence is "Hello". The implicit first token of the sentence is <S>, resulting in the bigram "<S>". There are no trigram and fourgram for the first word, so those columns are empty. The value stored for the bigram is 1.051147e+01, the value stored for the unigram is 1.223186e+01. ProdLMWrapper uses these to calculate a smoothed cost of .

The line with the exclamation mark shows entries for n-grams ending in "!": the fourgram "Hello , world !" has a value of 1.622149e+00, the trigram ", world !" has a value of 6.229870e+00, etc. NOTFOUND (which is shown as the value for the fourgram ", world ! <S>") indicates that the particular n-gram is not stored in the model.

Baseline LM Results Summary:
=============================

Here are the out-of-vocabulary (OoV) rates and perplexity (PPL)/n-gram hit ratios on the first 10 shards of the held out data (heldout-monolingual.tokenized.shuffled/news.en.heldout-0000?-of-00050)

See README.perplexity_and_such for a description on how we compute perplexity, out-of-vocabulary rate,
and back-off hit ratios.
